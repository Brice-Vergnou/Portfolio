                        <p>
                            I am a French developer with a deep passion for artificial intelligence, mathematics, and computer science. I enjoy visualizing and working with data, as well as training models. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my greatest strengths is my capacity for learning. I can quickly grasp new concepts and apply them effectively, making it easy for me to explain complex ideas in simple terms to others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I am a student at ENSEEIHT in the Computer Science department, where I am focused on specializing in artificial intelligence.

                <p>
                    I recently traveled to Benalm√°dena, Andalusia, Spain, where I immersed myself in the local culture and language. This experience has reinforced my desire to study and potentially work in a global setting.

                    I am considering becoming a volunteer at the SPA (Society for the Protection of Animals), as I feel drawn to directly assisting animals in need. Volunteering at SPA would allow me to make a tangible impact, which I feel was lacking when I was part of my high school's environmental club, where my role felt more like raising awareness than taking direct action.

                <p>
                    When researchers use omics data, they face the curse of dimensionality: their data have too many features compared to the number of records. To fix this problem, I and another intern tried to replicate a few papers to see how to reduce the dimensions of those datasets while keeping a maximum of information.

                <p>
                    I am considering a career in artificial intelligence, potentially as a data scientist, engineer, or even a researcher. I am also thinking about pursuing a Ph.D. to deepen my expertise and contribute to advancing the field of AI.
